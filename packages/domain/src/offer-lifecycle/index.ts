/**
 * Offer state machine — deep module (OH-179, deepens OH-113).
 *
 * Pure-TS per ADR-0004 (no DB / Stripe / Supabase imports; collaborators are
 * injected at the handler layer). Encodes the v1 Offer state graph from
 * CONTEXT.md § Offer + § negotiable + ADR-0006 § Decision 5 (narrowed by
 * ADR-0011 to Caregiver-only), ADR-0014 (multi-day `slots[]` → one Booking per
 * slot, no Series), ADR-0017 (`negotiable` gate), ADR-0018 (Tip lives on the
 * Booking receipt, never on the Offer).
 *
 *   pending → accepted    (counterparty Accept; materialises Booking(s))
 *           → countered   (counterparty Counter — GATED by `negotiable`; the
 *                          previous Offer is sealed, the handler opens a
 *                          successor with `supersedes_offer_id` set to this id)
 *           → declined    (counterparty Decline)
 *           → expired     (valid_until passed without action)
 *           → withdrawn   (SENDER-initiated, from `pending` OR `accepted`)
 *
 *   accepted → withdrawn  (sender withdraws an already-accepted Offer →
 *                          cascade-cancels every Booking/Series it materialised
 *                          via `offerId`; ADR-0014 amended). `accepted` is
 *                          therefore NOT terminal — withdraw is its one exit.
 *
 * ── Caregiver-only (ADR-0011) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   Offers exist only on the Caregiver rail. Provider consultations are
 *   fixed-price slot-picks with no Offer (CONTEXT.md § Offer). Engagement is
 *   hourly — the `per_session` scope variant retired with the off-platform
 *   Provider tier, so `scope_type` is `hourly` only.
 *
 * ── Direct-Message materialisation ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *   At Accept on a Direct-Message Offer (anchor `thread`), the Offer goes
 *   `pending → accepted` AND the handler rebinds its anchor from `thread_id` to
 *   the freshly-materialised `job_id` (see direct-message-materialisation). A
 *   Posted-Job Offer (anchor `job`) takes the same transition without the
 *   materialisation/rebind — its anchor was a `job_id` from the start.
 *
 * ── Immutable snapshot ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   The pricing-snapshot fields (`proposedRate`, `scopeType`, `scopeQuantity`,
 *   `childCount`, `category`, `perChildSurchargeSnapshot`, `computedTotal`,
 *   `schedule`) are captured at send time and never re-derived from the
 *   Caregiver's profile; transitions never overwrite them.
 *
 * Pure + deterministic. No I/O. No clock is read — `now` is supplied on the
 * event so timer-driven transitions (`auto-expire`) stay deterministic.
